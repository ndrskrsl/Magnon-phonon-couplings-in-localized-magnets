  Abstract                 = {Polycrystalline YMn1−xInxO3 compounds were obtained by solid state reaction and found to present a blue color for high substitution rate. X-ray diffraction analyses reveal the formation of solid solutions and the increase of cell parameters following Vegard's law. Far infrared reflectivity and Raman scattering spectra show the presence of random disorder and structural modifications without phase transition. A detailed analysis of some phonon modes allows to explain the structural changes upon doping. It was found that monocaping \{YO7\} antiprisms are almost unaffected by substitution. However, results reveal the existence of two different \{MO5\} (M = In, Mn) trigonal bipyramids. Their apical Mn–O distances are shorter than In–O bonds and both distances increase with the substitution rate, which is consistent with the evolution of the cell parameters. },

  Abstract                 = {The imaging monochromatic mode of a neutron spectrometer with a multi-bladed \{RITA\} analyser system is so far unexplored. We present analytical calculations that define the mode. It is shown that the mode can be realised for \{PG\} (0 0 2) analyser crystals, from incident energies of about 3.2 meV and up, allowing the important cases of 3.7, 5.0 and 13.7 meV. Due to beam divergence, the neutron rays from neighbouring analyser blades are found to overlap slightly. Hence, the optimal use of the monochromatic imaging mode would be found by employing an adjustable radial collimator to limit the spread of the ray from each analyser blade. },

  Abstract                 = {A variational principle for the free energy is applied to the Hamiltonian for terbium in the ferromagnetic region to study the effect of interactions among spin waves having their origin in the strong crystalline electric fields. At high temperatures this `crystal field renormalization' has the effect of multiplying the crystal field parameters appearing in the spin-wave energies of the non-interacting theory by powers of the reduced magnetization. The powers are found to be close to those associated with the corresponding magnetic anisotropy coefficients. This leads to an appreciable temperature dependence of the spin-wave energies which, after allowing for exchange renormalization, appears to be in reasonable agreement with the inelastic neutron scattering results of Møller and Houmann. The ferromagnetic resonance measurements of Bagguley and Liesegang and of Stanford and Young have also been analysed and found to be consistent with this picture.},

  Abstract                 = {We have undertaken a new study of the magnetic and crystalline structures of YMnO 3 and HoMnO 3 using neutron diffraction combined with neutron polarimetry. It is shown how the long-standing problem of distinguishing between magnetic structure models which give nearly identical diffraction intensities may be resolved. The experiments show that the magnetic structure of YMnO 3 has space group P 6 3 ' (or P 6 3 ) rather than P 6 3 ' cm ' (or P 6 3 cm ) with Mn moments of 3.14(3) μ B inclined at 11(1)° to [10.0] (or [12.0] for P 6 3 ) in the (00.1) plane. For HoMnO 3 the experiments confirm the P 6 3 ' c ' m symmetry at 50 K and the spin-rotation transition leading to a low-temperature structure with magnetic space group P 6 3 ' cm '. In this structure both the Ho1 and Ho2 moments can order with spins parallel to [00.1] in ferromagnetic layers, anti-ferromagnetically coupled. The Ho1 and Ho2 moments in neighbouring layers are found to be oppositely oriented. The ordered moments at 2 K are 3.32(8), 4.17(13) and 1.31(11) μ B on the Mn, Ho1 and Ho2 atoms respectively. No evidence was found, in this zero-field study, for the magnetic transition at ≈5 K reported in the literature (Lottermoser et al2004 Nature 30 541; Vajk et al2005 Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 87601). Nuclear structure refinements show that in YMnO 3 at 10 K and in HoMnO 3 at all temperatures below 50 K any deviation of the manganese x parameter from 1/3 is less than 0.0008.},

  Abstract                 = {We have investigated magnetoelastic effects in multiferroic YMnO 3 below the antiferromagnetic phase transition, T N ≈ 70 K, using neutron powder diffraction. The a lattice parameter of the hexagonal unit cell of YMnO 3 decreases normally above T N , but decreases anomalously below T N , whereas the c lattice parameter increases with decreasing temperature and then increases anomalously below T N . The unit cell volume also undergoes an anomalous contraction below T N . By fitting the background thermal expansion for a non-magnetic lattice with the Einstein–Grüneisen equation, we determined the lattice strains Δ a , Δ c and Δ V due to the magnetoelastic effects as a function of temperature. We have also determined the temperature variation of the ordered magnetic moment of the Mn ion by fitting the measured Bragg intensities of the nuclear and magnetic reflections with the known crystal and magnetic structure models and have established that the lattice strain due to the magnetoelastic effect in YMnO 3 couples with the square of the ordered magnetic moment or the square of the order parameter of the antiferromagnetic phase transition.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent research activities on the linear magnetoelectric (ME) effect—induction of magnetization by an electric field or of polarization by a magnetic field—are reviewed. Beginning with a brief summary of the history of the ME effect since its prediction in 1894, the paper focuses on the present revival of the effect. Two major sources for 'large' ME effects are identified. (i) In composite materials the ME effect is generated as a product property of a magnetostrictive and a piezoelectric compound. A linear ME polarization is induced by a weak ac magnetic field oscillating in the presence of a strong dc bias field. The ME effect is large if the ME coefficient coupling the magnetic and electric fields is large. Experiments on sintered granular composites and on laminated layers of the constituents as well as theories on the interaction between the constituents are described. In the vicinity of electromechanical resonances a ME voltage coefficient of up to 90 V cm −1  Oe −1 is achieved, which exceeds the ME response of single-phase compounds by 3–5 orders of magnitude. Microwave devices, sensors, transducers and heterogeneous read/write devices are among the suggested technical implementations of the composite ME effect. (ii) In multiferroics the internal magnetic and/or electric fields are enhanced by the presence of multiple long-range ordering. The ME effect is strong enough to trigger magnetic or electrical phase transitions. ME effects in multiferroics are thus 'large' if the corresponding contribution to the free energy is large. Clamped ME switching of electrical and magnetic domains, ferroelectric reorientation induced by applied magnetic fields and induction of ferromagnetic ordering in applied electric fields were observed. Mechanisms favouring multiferroicity are summarized, and multiferroics in reduced dimensions are discussed. In addition to composites and multiferroics, novel and exotic manifestations of ME behaviour are investigated. This includes (i) optical second harmonic generation as a tool to study magnetic, electrical and ME properties in one setup and with access to domain structures; (ii) ME effects in colossal magnetoresistive manganites, superconductors and phosphates of the Li M PO 4 type; (iii) the concept of the toroidal moment as manifestation of a ME dipole moment; (iv) pronounced ME effects in photonic crystals with a possibility of electromagnetic unidirectionality. The review concludes with a summary and an outlook to the future development of magnetoelectrics research.},

  Abstract                 = {We have carried out temperature-dependent inelastic neutron scattering measurements of YMnO3 over the temperature range of 50-1303 K{,} covering both the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition (70 K){,} as well as the ferroelectric to paraelectric transition (1258 K). Measurements are accompanied by first principles calculations of phonon spectra for the sake of interpretation and analysis of the measured phonon spectra in the room temperature ferroelectric (P63cm) and high temperature paraelectric (P63/mmc) hexagonal phases of YMnO3. The comparison of the experimental and first-principles calculated phonon spectra highlights unambiguously a spin-phonon coupling character in YMnO3. This is further supported by the pronounced differences in the magnetic and non-magnetic phonon calculations. The calculated atomistic partial phonon contributions of the Y and Mn atoms are not affected by the inclusion of magnetic interactions{,} whereas the dynamical contribution of the O atoms is found to change. This highlights the role of the super-exchange interactions between the magnetic Mn cations{,} mediated by O bridges. Phonon dispersion relations have also been calculated{,} in the entire Brillouin zone{,} for both the hexagonal phases. In the high-temperature phase{,} unstable phonon mode at the K point is highlighted. The displacement pattern at the K-point indicates that the freezing of this mode along with the stable mode at the [Gamma]-point may lead to a stabilization of the low-temperature (P63cm) phase{,} inducing ferroelectricity. Furthermore{,} we have also estimated the mode Gruneisen parameter and volume thermal expansion behavior. The latter is found to agree with the available experimental data.},

This leads to a clear view of the transformation sequence, as follows. Hexagonal YMnO${\sb 3}$ is paraelectric in {\it P}6${\sb 3}$/{\it mmc} at elevated temperatures, and undergoes a single structural transition on cooling through 1250K to a ferrielectric phase in {\it P}6${\sb 3}${\it cm} that is retained through room temperature. At a much lower temperature, 70K, there is a magnetic transition from paramagnetic to a triangular antiferromagnetic arrangement, most likely with symmetry {\it P}6${\sb 3}${$^\prime$}{\it cm}{$^\prime$}. Comment is made on the unusual coupling of ferroelectric and magnetic domains reported to occur in this material, as well as on the so-called `giant magneto-elastic' effect.},

The heat conduction by the spin system is shown to be negligible in the vicinity of the transition point. The phonon thermal conductivity was studied when the transition temperature is much smaller than the Debye temperature adopting a simple spin-phonon coupling derived by a consideration of the change of energy of the spin system caused by the strain due to a phonon. Processes involving creation and annihilation of a phonon as well as scattering have been considered, and the anomalous temperature dependence of thermal conductivity at the transition point was understood in terms of the critical scattering of phonons by critical fluctuations of the energy density of the spin system which is revealed in the specific heat of the spins. Cases with more general types of the spin-phonon interaction are briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Hexagonal manganites are currently under intensive investigations because of their interesting multiferroic behavior. Here, we show that all the atomic positions exhibit drastic anomalies at the antiferromagnetic transition temperature, which we interpret as evidence of strong coupling between spin and lattice. This coupling, we argue, leads to further coupling to electric dipole moments. Our neutron diffraction data also show that there is strong frustration effect among Mn moments. This frustration gives rise to diffuse scattering, i.e. short-ranged spin correlations. We also discuss doping effects on the magnetic structure. },

  Abstract                 = {Since their discovery in 1963 the hexagonal manganites have consolidated their role as exotic ferroelectrics with astonishing functionalities. Their introduction as room-temperature device ferroelectrics was followed by observations of giant flexoelectricity, multiferroicity with magnetoelectric domain and domain-wall coupling, protected vortex domain structures, topological domain-scaling behaviour and domain walls with tunable conductance and magnetism. Even after half a century, however, the emergence of the ferroelectric state has remained the subject of fierce debate. We resolve the interplay of electric polarization, topological trimerization and temperature by direct access to the polarization for temperatures up to 1,400[thinsp]K. Nonlinear optical experiments and piezoresponse force microscopy, complemented by Monte Carlo simulations, reveal a single phase transition with ferroelectricity determined by topology rather than electrostatics. Fundamental properties of the hexagonal manganites, including an explanation for the two-phase-transition controversy as a finite-size scaling effect, are derived from this and highlight why improper ferroelectrics are an inherent source of novel functionalities.},

  Abstract                 = {A general bilinear two-Bose Hamiltonian is diagonalized and the result used in a discussion of non-interacting spin waves in a two-sub-lattice ferromagnet having not negligible anisotropy in the spin interaction. Model-independent functions suitable for the analysis of experimental dispersion curves are suggested. The magnon cross section for unpolarized neutrons is calculated and shown to be dependent on the anisotropy in the spin interaction. Thus in principle it allows the detection of anisotropy in the exchange interaction. Some remarks are made concerning antiferromagnetic and plane-helical structure. A numerical calculation is performed for terbium on the basis of the Kaplan-Lyons Hamiltonian(3) with added crystalline anisotropy. The non-isotropic exchange part is shown to have a small effect on the dispersion curves, and it turns out that radical changes of the Ruderman-Kittel-type functions for the exchange interaction seem to be necessary for agreement with experimental dispersion curves to be obtained. The effect of the anisotropy in the cross section is estimated and shown to be important for small magnon energies. },

  Abstract                 = {A general bilinear two-Bose Hamiltonian is diagonalized and the result used in a discussion of non-interacting spin waves in a two-sub-lattice ferromagnet having not negligible anisotropy in the spin interaction. Model-independent functions suitable for the analysis of experimental dispersion curves are suggested. The magnon cross section for unpolarized neutrons is calculated and shown to be dependent on the anisotropy in the spin interaction. Thus in principle it allows the detection of anisotropy in the exchange interaction. Some remarks are made concerning antiferromagnetic and plane-helical structure. A numerical calculation is performed for terbium on the basis of the Kaplan-Lyons Hamiltonian(3) with added crystalline anisotropy. The non-isotropic exchange part is shown to have a small effect on the dispersion curves, and it turns out that radical changes of the Ruderman-Kittel-type functions for the exchange interaction seem to be necessary for agreement with experimental dispersion curves to be obtained. The effect of the anisotropy in the cross section is estimated and shown to be important for small magnon energies. },

  Abstract                 = {Multiferroic materials support intertwined ferromagnetic and ferroelectric orders, with the magnetic field capable of controlling the electric order and vice versa. Matsubara et al. used second harmonic generation microscopy to visualize what happens to the ferroelectric domains in the multiferroic TbMnO3 when an externally applied magnetic field changes the direction of electric polarization by 90{\textdegree}. Unexpectedly, the domain walls, initially parallel to the polarization vector, did not change their shape or position. The resulting transition from neutral to charged domain walls may help in the development of future ferroelectric devices.Science, this issue p. 1112The manipulation of domains by external fields in ferroic materials is of major interest for applications. In multiferroics with strongly coupled magnetic and electric order, however, the magnetoelectric coupling on the level of the domains is largely unexplored. We investigated the field-induced domain dynamics of TbMnO3 in the multiferroic ground state and across a first-order spin-flop transition. In spite of the discontinuous nature of this transition, the reorientation of the order parameters is deterministic and preserves the multiferroic domain pattern. Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations reveal that this behavior is intrinsic. Such magnetoelectric correlations in spin-driven ferroelectrics may lead to domain wall{\textendash}based nanoelectronics devices.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiferroics, materials where spontaneous long-range magnetic and dipolar orders coexist, represent an attractive class of compounds, which combine rich and fascinating fundamental physics with a technologically appealing potential for applications in the general area of spintronics. Ab initio calculations have significantly contributed to recent progress in this area, by elucidating different mechanisms for multiferroicity and providing essential information on various compounds where these effects are manifestly at play. In particular, here we present examples of density-functional theory investigations for two main classes of materials: (a) multiferroics where ferroelectricity is driven by hybridization or purely structural effects, with BiFeO 3 as the prototype material, and (b) multiferroics where ferroelectricity is driven by correlation effects and is strongly linked to electronic degrees of freedom such as spin-, charge-, or orbital-ordering, with rare-earth manganites as prototypes. As for the first class of multiferroics, first principles calculations are shown to provide an accurate qualitative and quantitative description of the physics in BiFeO 3 , ranging from the prediction of large ferroelectric polarization and weak ferromagnetism, over the effect of epitaxial strain, to the identification of possible scenarios for coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic order. For the second class of multiferroics, ab initio calculations have shown that, in those cases where spin-ordering breaks inversion symmetry (e.g. in antiferromagnetic E-type HoMnO 3 ), the magnetically induced ferroelectric polarization can be as large as a few µC cm −2 . The examples presented point the way to several possible avenues for future research: on the technological side, first principles simulations can contribute to a rational materials design , aimed at identifying spintronic materials that exhibit ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity at or above room temperature. On the fundamental side, ab initio approaches can be used to explore new mechanisms for ferroelectricity by exploiting electronic correlations that are at play in transition metal oxides, and by suggesting ways to maximize the strength of these effects as well as the corresponding ordering temperatures.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiferroic materials, in which ferroelectric and magnetic ordering coexist, are of fundamental interest for the development of multi-state memory devices that allow for electrical writing and non-destructive magnetic read-out operation. The great challenge is to create multiferroic materials that operate at room-temperature and have a large ferroelectric polarization P. Cupric oxide, CuO, is promising because it exhibits a significant polarization, i.e. P {\textasciitilde} 0.1 {\^I}?C.cm({\^a}??2), for a spin-spiral multiferroic. Unfortunately CuO is only ferroelectric in a temperature range of 20 K, from 210 to 230 K. Here, using a combination of density functional theory and Monte Carlo calculations, we establish that pressure-driven phase competition induces a giant stabilization of the multiferroic phase of CuO, which at 20-40 GPa becomes stable in a domain larger than 300 K, from 0 to T > 300 K. Thus, under high-pressure, CuO is predicted to be a room-temperature multiferroic with large polarization.},

  Abstract                 = {The manganite oxides, YMnO[sub 3] and ErMnO[sub 3] having hexagonal structures were prepared by the solid state reaction method. After characterizing these materials by studying their various physical properties such as lattice parameters, X-ray density, bulk density etc., ultrasonic velocity measurements were carried out over a temperature range 80–300 K to investigate their elastic behavior. As the materials are porous, the measured elastic moduli were corrected to zero porosity. Using the room temperature elastic moduli, Debye temperature values of both the manganites have also been obtained. Surprisingly it has been found that the Young's moduli of both the materials increase continuously with decreasing temperature. A qualitative explanation for the observed behavior is offered.

  Abstract                 = {The hexagonal {\it R}MnO${\sb 3}$({\it h}-{\it R}MnO${\sb 3}$) are multiferroic materials, which exhibit the coexistence of a magnetic order and ferroelectricity. Their distinction is in their geometry that both results in an unusual mechanism to break inversion symmetry and also produces a two-dimensional triangular lattice of Mn spins, which is subject to geometrical magnetic frustration due to the antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest-neighbor Mn ions. This unique combination makes the {\it h}-{\it R}MnO${\sb 3}$ a model system to test ideas of spin-lattice coupling, particularly when both the improper ferroelectricity and the Mn trimerization that appears to determine the symmetry of the magnetic structure arise from the same structure distortion. In this review we demonstrate how the use of both neutron and X-ray diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering techniques have been essential to paint this comprehensive and coherent picture of {\it h}-{\it R}MnO${\sb 3}$.},

At lower temperatures there is magnetic ordering of the frustrated Mn 3+ spins ( S = 2) on a triangular Mn lattice (YMnO 3: T N = 71 K; LuMnO 3: T N = 90 K and ScMnO 3: T N = 130 K). The transition is characterized by a sharp kink in the magnetic susceptibility at T N below which it continues to increase due to the frustration on the triangular lattice. The specific heat shows one clear continuous phase transition at T N , which is independent of external magnetic field up to 9 T with an entropy content as expected for Mn 3+ ions. The temperature-dependent dielectric constant displays a distinct anomaly at T N .},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes the direct calculation of the microscopic contributions to the magneto-electric coupling, using ab initio methods. The electrostrictive and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya contributions were evaluated individually. For this purpose a specific method was designed, combining density functional theory calculations and embedded fragment, explicitly correlated, quantum chemical calculations. This method allowed us to calculate the evolution of the magnetic couplings as a function of an applied electric field. We found that in YMnO 3 the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya contribution to the magneto-electric effect is three orders of magnitude weaker than the electrostrictive contribution. Strictive effects are thus dominant in the magnetic exchange evolution under an applied electric field, and by extension in the magneto-electric effect. These effects however, remain quite small, and the modifications of the magnetic excitations under an applied electric field will be difficult to observe experimentally. Another important conclusion is that it can be shown that the linear magneto-electric tensor is null due to the inter-layer symmetry operations.},

  Abstract                 = {Antiferromagnets are hard to control by external magnetic fields because of the alternating directions of magnetic moments on individual atoms and the resulting zero net magnetization. However, relativistic quantum mechanics allows for generating current-induced internal fields whose sign alternates with the periodicity of the antiferromagnetic lattice. Using these fields, which couple strongly to the antiferromagnetic order, we demonstrate room-temperature electrical switching between stable configurations in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs thin film devices by applied current with magnitudes of order 106 Acm-2. Electrical writing is combined in our solid-state memory with electrical readout and the stored magnetic state is insensitive to and produces no external magnetic field perturbations, which illustrates the unique merits of antiferromagnets for spintronics.},

  Abstract                 = {Enhancement of polarization and related properties in heteroepitaxially constrained thin films of the ferroelectromagnet, BiFeO3, is reported. Structure analysis indicates that the crystal structure of film is monoclinic in contrast to bulk, which is rhombohedral. The films display a room-temperature spontaneous polarization (50 to 60 microcoulombs per square centimeter) almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the bulk (6.1 microcoulombs per square centimeter). The observed enhancement is corroborated by first-principles calculations and found to originate from a high sensitivity of the polarization to small changes in lattice parameters. The films also exhibit enhanced thickness-dependent magnetism compared with the bulk. These enhanced and combined functional responses in thin film form present an opportunity to create and implement thin film devices that actively couple the magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters.},
